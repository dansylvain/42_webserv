## CURRENT WORK
- Wait for Dan to parse de boundary Token

## HOTFIX :
- Stabilize simple GET / DELETE REQUESTS
- Exploit the Content-Type header for post requests
- If there is `Content-Type: multipart/form-data;`, then activate the
unfinished branch
IF NOT : Need to generate a random 10 lenghts string + an extension to save the file
-


## Mandatory Work but can wait
- Delete duplicates nodes with the same URI in `extractRouteConfig`

- Clear nodes without the URI in `extractRouteConfig`

- Clear useless variables



# ULTRA BONUS AND EDGE CASE
- Delete webserv => 401 + kill the client

- Generate `listing.html` on the go instead of writting files to the disk. âœ…

- transversal attacks "../" (can go further with analyzing if "../" does exit root or not)
