## 🚀 SYNOPSIS

The `webserv` project challenges students to build a fully functional HTTP/1.1 server in the C++ language.

This endeavor requires a profound understanding of network programming, socket management, and the HTTP protocol. Students are tasked with implementing a server capable of handling multiple simultaneous connections, serving static files, and managing dynamic content.

The project not only sharpens skills in network communication but also delves into the intricacies of request parsing, response formatting, and efficient resource management.

Successfully completing `webserv` demonstrates a mastery of network programming and solidifies the understanding of essential web server concepts in Unix-like operating systems.
