# EXECUTION ROADMAP :

## BUILDING HEADER
- Extract Method (GET, POST or DELETE) âœ…
- Get URI âœ…
- Resolve URI  
	==> Rooted path from config file â›”
	==> transversal attacks "../" (can go further with analyzing if "../" does exit root or not) âœ…

- Validate URI
	==> Is the URI accessible  âœ…
	==> Is the path a directory  âœ…
	==> Is the path a CGI  â›”
	==> Does the route accepts the current method  â›”
	==> Definir une redirection HTTP â›” (possibly send a CODE_300 and let the client sent back another GET request)
	==> DEFINE AUTHORIZATION DEPENDING ON THE METHOD  âœ…
		# GET Request:
			* Read Permission: The server needs to read the file or directory contents.
			* POSIX Permission: R_OK (Read permission)
		# POST Request:
			* Write Permission: The server needs to write data to the file or directory.
			* POSIX Permission: W_OK (Write permission)
			* Execute Permission: If the target is a directory, the server needs execute permission to access the directory.
			* POSIX Permission: X_OK (Execute permission)
		# DELETE Request:
			* Write Permission: The server needs to delete the file or directory.
			* POSIX Permission: W_OK (Write permission)
			* Execute Permission: If the target is a directory, the server needs execute permission to access the directory.
			* POSIX Permission: X_OK (Execute permission)

	==> HTML Generator for Listing Directories ðŸ”¥
		#   TimeStamp checker for avoiding making twice the same work (also) ðŸ”¥

- Executing the CGI â›”
	==> Possibly extract timestamp from Last-Modified CGI code source for avoiding generating twice the same CGI.html ( depends if the CGI.py does outputs the same thing or not, will depend mosty on PATH_INFO and body, if one or another are exploited)

- Checker a chaque fois les authos des fichiers d'erreurs. Si un 404 est corrompu/illisible ou introuvable, en generer un a la volee (ou simplement renvoyer le code au navigateur)


## BUILDING BODY
- Done by Seb, needs explanations on the stream â›”



## HOTFIX :

Retour de page IMAGES foireux âœ… => image_chat.jpeg was an empty file

Refactorer le timestamp path access to a higher scope, accessible to all clients (needs a generic function for CGI as well)
